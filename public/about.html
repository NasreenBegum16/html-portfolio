<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! Iâ€™m Nasreen Begum, a tech enthusiast, problem solver, and someone who loves a good challengeâ€”whether itâ€™s debugging code or figuring out what to eat for dinner! ðŸ˜† When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me exploring new places, enjoying flowers ðŸŒ¸, or just vibing with good music.
  This birthday, Iâ€™d love to celebrate with amazing friends like you! So, come join me for some fun, laughter, and cake (lots of it)! ðŸŽ‚âœ¨</p>
